## Google Hangout Video Conference Recording Steps

Our hangout video conferences were recorded with google hangout on air and will be uploaded to the recorder's personal YouTube account. The video will be private and only posted in our private google plus community "Seattle Algorithm Discussion Group". The community is a private and unlisted thus cannot be searched.

2. Start or schedule Hangout on air (Note: must be on air) at [hangouts.google.com](https://hangouts.google.com/), **make sure to clear out the audience** and add yourself and our g+ community "Seattle Algorithm Discussion Group" in the audience.
3. Invite participants or share the link in our g+ hangout chat group.

### Tips and Traps

2. You need to find that shared screen in the bottom row as shown in the screen shot below and select to present it to everyone.
