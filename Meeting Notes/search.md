1. [Rank from Stream] Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
to look up the rank of a number `x` (the number of values less than or equal to `x`).  
Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method
`track(int x)`, which is called when each number is generated, and the method `getRankOfNumber(int x)`,
which returns the number of values less than or equal to `x` (not including `x` itself).

2.  
  * Given an array `A` of `n` distinct integers, design an algorithm to find a local minimum: an index `i` such that `A[i-1] < A[i] < A[i+1]`.
  * Given an `n * n` matrix `A` of `n^2` numbers, find a pair `(i, j)` such that `A[i][j] < A[i+1][j]`, `A[i][j] < A[i][j+1]`, `A[i][j] < A[i-1][j]`, and `A[i][j] < A[i][j-1]`.

3. Given an array `A`, find the maximum `j-i` such that `A[j] > A[i]`.
