1. [Rank from Stream] Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
to look up the rank of a number `x` (the number of values less than or equal to `x`).  
Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method
`track(int x)`, which is called when each number is generated, and the method `getRankOfNumber(int x)`,
which returns the number of values less than or equal to `x` (not including `x` itself).

2. [Sparse Search] Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, write a function to find the location of a given string.

3. [Peak in Bitonic Sequence] You are given an array whose elements are weakly monotonically increasing and then weakly monotonically decreasing. Find the max element in this array.  
Note: Duplicates are allowed.

4. [Local Min 1D] Given an array `A` of `n` distinct integers, design an algorithm to find a local minimum: an index `i` such that `A[i-1] < A[i] < A[i+1]`.

5. [Local Min 2D] Given an `n * n` matrix `A` of `n^2` numbers, find a pair `(i, j)` such that `A[i][j] < A[i+1][j]`, `A[i][j] < A[i][j+1]`, `A[i][j] < A[i-1][j]`, and `A[i][j] < A[i][j-1]`.

6. [Distance Maximizing] Given an array `A`, find the maximum `j - i` such that `A[j] > A[i]`.

7. [[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)] Given an array `A`, find the maximum `A[j] - A[i]` such that `j > i`.

8. [Count Zeros in Matrix] Given a matrix `A` of size `X * Y`, filled with integers. Rows and columns of the matrix are sorted in ascending order. Find the number of zeros in the matrix.

9. [[Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)] Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.
